    * There are three types of testing 
        1. e2e testing also known as "End to End testing"
        2. Integration testing 
        3. Unit testing

    * End to End Testing: 
        A real life example of "End to End testing" would be if a laptop manufactor, 
        let his employees open some off the assembly line laptops turn them on and use 
        them like a normal user would do to make sure that the entire in product 
        behaves as it should. More specific to web development "End to End testing"
        tries to imiates how a user might interact with your app. 
        
        This means that in "End to End testing" you need to open your web application 
        in a web browser and then test it by interacting with the page the same a user 
        might interact with the pages. For example, clicking on the log in button are 
        going through the process of of adding an item to the shopping cart. 
        In other words, you are testing the entire finished software product from the 
        perspective of the end user. 

        No here's something you may find interesting. The person testing the app doesn't 
        have to be a developer. 

        Finally, "End to End testing" are the slowest and take the most time to set up 
        and run. Here are a few examples of "End to End tesing" (E2E) frameworks
        available on the market: 1. Webdriver.js, 2. Protractor and 3. Cypress 
    
    * Integration Testing: 
        Integration testing is testing how parts of your system interact with other
        parts of your system. In other words, it's testing how separate parts of your 
        apps work together. Let's explore two examples of integration testing software: 
        1. "react testing library" and 2. "Enzyme". 

        "Integration" testing are faster and cheaper than "End to End testing" but not 
        as fast or as cheap as unit testing. 

    * Unit Testing: 
        What is unit testing? unit testing is the process of testing the smallest units 
        of your source code in isolation. A good example of unit testing this is 
        funcitons. A unit is the smallest piece of code that you can test separately
        from the rest of the app. Practically the smallest unit of testable code in 
        Js is usuallty a function or a method. Unit tests are self contained. 
        They're meant to test code in isolation, preferably separate from the rest of 
        your app. This makes unit tests fast to run and easy to write.
