/*
    * In this exercise, you will work with some data provided as an array of objects, 
listing information about dishes available in the Little Lemon restaurant. 

You will need to write a function declaration which will be able to do two things:

1. If the function is called with the argument "true", it will output the names of 
the dishes and calculate their final price (including 20% tax)

2. If the function is called with the argument "false", it will output the names of 
the dishes and give their prices without the additional tax 

The expected outcome is that all the dishe' names and prices will be shown in the 
console output.
